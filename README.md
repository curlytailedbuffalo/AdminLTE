Using **[AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com)**, this project will create a Web interface for the ad-blocking Pi-hole: **a black hole for Internet advertisements**.

From this interface, you will be able to see stats on how well your Pi-hole is performing.  You will also be able to update the lists used to block ads.
